#### Install dependencies using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt (system packages are not included here)

pip --version
pip list
pip list packageName
pip install packageName
pip uninstall packageName
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze (to see all the packages installed)
pip freeze > requirements.txt

pip install --upgrade package-name  (This command tells pip to install the latest version of the package and uninstall the old version.)
pip install --upgrade pip   (to upgrade pip itself)

The -U option in pip install -U langchain stands for --upgrade. It means that pip will upgrade the package langchain-community to the latest version if itâ€™s already installed. If the package is not installed, pip will install the latest version.

## Poetry

## pyenv
pyenv for listing all the subcommands
pyenv version
pyenv versions
pyenv update (to update pyenv)
pyenv install --list
pyenv install 3.11 (installs latest version)

pyenv shell command only activates a particular python version for the shell that you ran that command line. And so when I opened up a new shell or a new terminal session, we can see that the PI shell command was no longer in effect. If we want to change to a version of Python system wide, we can use pyenv global and then a python version.
pyenv global 3.11.9
pyenv uninstall 3.11.7
