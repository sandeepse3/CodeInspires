    "1. We have our class method decorator now again like the static method decorator this is used for a method inside of a class and what this will do is transform the first implicit parameter or argument (cls) to be the name or instance of the class (Person), but not an individual object. \n",
    "So typically when you call a method you have that first parameter which is self like that and then maybe we'd return something like the name of this Person like (self.name), now when we use the class method decorator rather than getting access to the instance in which this method was called on, we get access to the class so Person itself, now what that means is that we can only access attributes which are class attributes like the one defined here (species = \"Homo sapiens\") or other class or static methods, __so we can pretty much only access anything that's defined on the class not on the instance__.\n",
    "2. So again if we go here we can print the value of CLS and you'll notice that we get the class <class '\\__main\\__.Person>', we don't get an instance of the class we get the itself, that allows us to access something like a class attribute and to access other class methods or static methods. If this was a static method, we would not be able to access this class attribute 'species'\n",
    "3. In summary, use a class method decorator when you want to access class attributes or other class or static methods and use a static method decorator when the function is completely independent and it doesn't need to access anything else associated with the class or with the instance of that class"

    "Python does not support strict private and protected variables. Private variables in Python are typically denoted by using a double underscore prefix (__) before the variable name. This prefix triggers the name mangling process, which replaces the variable name with a mangled version that includes the class name (_MyClass__private_value). This mangled name is used internally within the class, making it less accessible from outside the class.\n"
